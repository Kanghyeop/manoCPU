REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/lab16_matbi_0/inst/u_bram0/ram_reg_0 has an input control pin design_1_i/lab16_matbi_0/inst/u_bram0/ram_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: design_1_i/lab16_matbi_0/inst/u_bram0/ADDRARDADDR[7]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/lab16_matbi_0/inst/myip_v1_0_inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/mem0_addr_cnt_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
